Done: August 16
Tuesday, 2016: Full day hanging out in Couer d'Alene. Had a leisurely breakfast of beer pancakes and sat around then went down to the beach. Got to try out the paddle board. Did a handstand. Then lunch and walking around. Went to a baby store and a toy store and a book store. Bought a space-themed swim diaper. Late dinner back at the house. Really enjoying Leslie and Andy. They're great hosts. Bubbly belly as I went to bed. Not sure why. Played a little joke with a polaroid and a snow globe.

Sunday, 2015: Cleaned out the garage and got all of my camping and biking stuff put back together. Rode to the farmer's market with Rachael. Felt really nice to be back on the Surly. So comfortable, if slow. Came back with delicious peaches, too expensive cheese, corn, and a few other things. Up to Mom's in the evening for our birthday party. Good to get Gordy and Suellen up there. Talked about the ectopic pregnancy with Mom and Mark and Gordy and Suellen. Weird to be in the middle of it but better out in the open than not. Rachael was pretty upset as we were going to bed, wishing we'd never even tried. Just part of the process, I hope.

Saturday, 2014: Funny to look back to a year ago and see how concerned I was about getting my shoes figured out. In my defense, though, I had the right shoes in Qatar. Anyway, had considered taking a hike with Gordy and Suellen, but ended up hanging out around town instead. Drove down to Wilsonville to hang out with Kjerstine and the kids, play in the fountains and stuff.

Friday, 2013: Went to OPB to say hi and bye to folks there. Lunch with Steven Kray. I love that guy. Then back up the hill on a trail through a garden listening to This American Life. Then downtown to get shoes figured out (bought a pair of blue suede) and then drinks and dinner with Rick and Denise. It was a lot of fun.
